RoundcubeSkins Skins plugin for Roundcube
=========================================

This plugin provides extended functionality to roundcubeskins.net skins. 

It also fixes some third party plugins compatibility issues. Some of the third party plugins treat larry-based skins 
as "classic", which leads to functionality and display problems. This plugin fixes the issues by substituting the
config skin name with "larry" for the plugins in question. 

INSTALLATION
============

To install the plugin, copy the folder "rcs_skins" to the "plugins" directory of your Roundcube installation and add a 
reference to it in the config file as shown below.

IMPORTANT: If you would like this plugin to fix the the third party plugin compatibility issues, make sure "rcs_skins" 
is included at the beginning of the plugin list, before any other plugins. If you don't use any third party plugins 
that need fixing, the order doesn't matter. 

For Roundcube 1.x:
------------------

Edit the file and "config/config.inc.php" and add the reference to the plugin to the $config['plugins'] variable:

$config['plugins'] = array("rcs_skins");

For Roundcube 0.9.x:
-------------------- 

Edit the file "config/main.inc.php" and add the reference to the plugin to the $rcmail_config['plugins'] variable:

$rcmail_config['plugins'] = array("rcs_skins");
